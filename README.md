# Randomness Advnaced Algorithm

Suppose you are given an array A of distinct integers of size 𝑁 (it contains 𝑁 distinct integers) and a positive integer 𝑘 that is less than or equal to N (1 ≤ 𝑘 ≤ 𝑁). You are asked to do a select operation which is to select the integer in the given array A which is larger than exactly 𝑘 − 1 other elements of A

(a)This select operation can be thought of as a sorting operation
followed by selecting the 𝑘𝑡ℎ element of the sorted array. Implement a recursive quick sort algorithm for this and implement your select operation. 

(b) Implement a randomized algorithm as a recursive algorithm to perform the select operation.
